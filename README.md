# ACM AI Neural Network Modeling Competition üîÆ

---

Welcome to the Winter 2022 Neural Network Modeling Competition! This competition will run for the entirety of Winter Quarter 2022 ‚ùÑÔ∏è

This repository contains some starter code in `easy` and `medium` directories that you can run and submit to the competition at https://ai.acmucsd.com/competitions/nn.

The distinction between `easy` and `medium` is that `easy` contains 3D Data while `medium` contains 4D Data.

## Competition Tiers

For this competition, we want to bring out the best and brightest ideas from our competitors! To do this, we will be awarding winners across 3 Model Parameter + Training Epoch Tiers which are defined below:

| Competition Tier | # of Model Parameters | # of Training Epochs |
|------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| Feather-weight   | 1 param <= x params <= 5k params | 1 epoch <= x epochs <= 300 epochs |
| Middle-weight    | 5,001 params <= x params <= 10,000 params | 301 epochs <= x epochs <= 400 epochs |
| Heavy-weight     | 10,001 params <= x params <= 15,000 params | 401 epochs <= x epochs <= 500 epochs |

Your models **must** meet the requirements for at least 1 row in the `Competition Tier` table for your submission(s) to be considered in the final ranking.

**Note**: You are allowed to submit to all Competition Tiers if you'd like!
