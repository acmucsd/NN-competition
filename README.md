# ACM AI Neural Network Modeling Competition üîÆ

---

Welcome to the Winter 2022 Neural Network Modeling Competition! This competition will run for the entirety of Winter Quarter 2022 ‚ùÑÔ∏è

This repository contains some starter code in `easy` and `medium` directories that you can run and submit to the competition at https://ai.acmucsd.com/competitions/nn.

The distinction between `easy` and `medium` is that `easy` contains 3D Data while `medium` contains 4D Data.
